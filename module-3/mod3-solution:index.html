						The history of chickens (Gallus domesticus) is a bit of a puzzle. They were first domesticated from a wild form called red junglefowl (Gallus gallus), a bird that still runs wild in most of southeast Asia, likely hybridized with the gray junglefowl (G. sonneratii). That occurred probably about 8,000 years ago. Recent research suggests there may have been multiple origins in distinct areas of South and Southeast Asia, southern China, Thailand, Burma, and India. THE EVIDENCE FOR DOMESTIC CHICKEN ORIGINS Since the wild progenitor of chickens is still among us, comparisons of behavior and other differences between the wild and domestic forms are available to us. Behaviorally, domesticated chickens are less active, have fewer social interactions, are less aggressive to would-be predators, and are less likely to go looking for foreign food sources than their wild ancestors. Other changes include increased adult body weight and simplified plumage; domestic chicken egg production starts earlier, is more frequent, and produces larger eggs.Genetic studies hint at multiple origins of domestication. The earliest archaeological evidence to date is from China about 5400 BC, in geographically widespread sites such as Cishan (Hebei province, ca 5300 BC), Beixin (Shandong province, ca 5000 BC), and Xian (Shaanxi province, ca 4300 BC). In 2014, a few studies were published supporting the identification of early chicken domestication in northern and central China (Xiang et al.).However, their results remain controversial.A 2016 study (Eda et al.) of 280 bird bones reported as chicken from Neolithic and Bronze age sites in northern and central China found that only a handful could securely be identified as actually chicken. Peters and colleagues (2016) looked at environmental proxies in addition to other research and concluded that the habitats conducive to jungle fowl were not present early enough.Researchers suggest that chickens were a rare occurrence in northern and Central China, and thus probably an import from southern China or Southeast Asia where evidence of domestication is stronger.
