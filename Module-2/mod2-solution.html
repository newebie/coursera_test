    <div id="title-1" class="title">French Bulldog</div>
    <p id="p1">The French Bulldog has the appearance of an active, intelligent, muscular dog of heavy bone, smooth coat, compactly built, and of medium or small structure. Expression alert, curious, and interested. Any alteration other than removal of dewclaws is considered mutilation and is a disqualification.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="col2">
    <div id="title-2" class="title">German Shepherd</div>
    <p id="p2">The first impression of a good German Shepherd Dog is that of a strong, agile, well muscled animal, alert and full of life. It is well balanced, with harmonious development of the forequarter and hindquarter. The dog is longer than tall, deep-bodied, and presents an outline of smooth curves rather than angles.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="col3">
    <div id="title-3" class="title">Chihuahua</div>
    <p id="p3">A graceful, alert, swift-moving compact little dog with saucy expression, and with terrier-like qualities of temperament.</p>
